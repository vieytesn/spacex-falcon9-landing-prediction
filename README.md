## 🚀 Project Contents

### ✔️ 1. Data Collection  
APIs, web scraping, and dataset integration.

### ✔️ 2. Data Wrangling  
Cleaning, feature engineering, missing value handling, and dataset preparation.

### ✔️ 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Visualizations, trend analysis, correlation studies, and Orbit/Payload insights.

### ✔️ 4. SQL Analysis  
Queries used to extract structured insights from the dataset.

### ✔️ 5. Interactive Visualizations  
- Folium map displaying launch sites  
- Plotly Dash dashboard with interactive filters  

### ✔️ 6. Machine Learning  
Models evaluated:
- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Decision Tree Classifier
